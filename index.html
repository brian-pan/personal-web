        <p>Hello! Thank you for visiting my website.</p>
        <p>
          My name is Brian, and I'm a self-learned web developer based in
          Toronto who previously studied Statistical Science.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love working collaboratively and create user-friendly accessible
          applications.
        </p>
        <p>I care about environment and sustainability.</p>
        <p>
          In my spare time I'd like to cooking, gaming, hiking,driving, trimming
          my indoor garden, and playing with my cute Chinchillas named Coffee
          and Cream.

          An self-built full-stack application with MongoDB,Express, React, and
          NodeJS (MERN). Users are able to explore various recipes created by
          other users and write their reviews for these recipes. An user can
          view, edit, and write their own recipes after register/login. All data
          including users, dish recipes, and their associated reviews are
          processed and passed using Redux and Express, then stored in MongoDB.
